# To Do

~~We need to implement some basic machine learning algorithm to extract the image with people or person in them~~
We still need to download over 80 images, I am working on that and will be available very soon.

# Reference
The image scraping script is referenced from [Handhika Yanuar Pratama](https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-automatically-download-bulk-images-for-your-dataset-using-python-f1efffba7a03) 
The face detection idea is refrenced from Mr. Khaing Htoo Ko.
