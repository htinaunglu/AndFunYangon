# First Commit

We can use `gsearch.py` to search for google image of any keyword and pass the file names into a csv file.

We need to implement some basic machine learning algorithm to extract the image with people or person in them

# Reference
The image scraping script is referenced from [Handhika Yanuar Pratama]("https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-automatically-download-bulk-images-for-your-dataset-using-python-f1efffba7a03")
